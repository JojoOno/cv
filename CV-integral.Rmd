\faIcon{lightbulb} Research Interests
============================

I am an applied environmental scientist and quantitative ecologist specializing in the spatial and behavioral ecology of marine predators, with particular expertise in pinniped movement, foraging dynamics, and impacts of offshore wind and tidal energy installations. My research integrates advanced statistical modelling, telemetry, and environmental data to quantify how physical and biological processes, especially those associated with renewable energy infrastructure, influence animal behavior, distribution, and population risk.

I have a strong track record of translating ecological insights into practical tools for industry and policy, including collision risk modelling and impact assessments for marine energy projects. I am Skilled in designing and leading field programs in challenging environments. Expertise spans statistical modelling (GLMs, GAMs, GEEs, HMMs), predictive habitat mapping, and regulatory-relevant impact assessments under frameworks analogous to NEPA, CEQA, and NPDES. Experienced in equipment calibration, troubleshooting, and maintenance, as well as mentoring field crews and junior scientists. Dedicated to producing decision-relevant science that bridges ecology, technology, and policy, while ensuring the highest standards of safety, integrity, and quality management. My work has focused on both single species and multi-species approaches with advanced understanding of broad marine ecosystem interactions, including seabirds, fish, benthic habitats and marine mammals. Through extensive collaboration with stakeholders, I have helped shape conservation strategies and regulatory guidance in high-conflict marine environments. My work bridges quantitative ecology, oceanography, and conservation physiology, and is underpinned by a commitment to producing robust, reproducible, and decision-relevant science.

\faIcon{chart-bar} Statistics
---------------------------------

1. **Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalised Additive Models (GAMs).** Used to account for non-linear relationships with complex and dynamic habitat covariates. Examples include modelling dive behaviour of seals as a complex interactive function of a suite of fine-scale habitat drivers of behaviour such as diurnal patterns, tidal stream vectors of movement and bathymetric variables.

2. **GAMs with Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs).** These models were employed to handle temporal autocorrelation, typical in systematic animal observation data of the same individuals. This allowed robust estimation of population level trends while accounting for within-subject correlation. Examples include estimating behavioural response curves enabling quantification of avoidance behaviour of seals at varying distances from operational tidal turbines.

3. **Time-series and state-space modelling (including Hidden Markov Models).** Developed and applied unique Hidden Markov Models and state-space models to infer latent behavioural states from seal movement and dive data in areas where observed movement is intrinsically biased. These models incorporated depth, dive duration, movement speed and turning angles to probabilistically assign behavioural states at fine temporal scales. Integrated the concept of “hydrospace” into the data streams by combining tidal flow vectors with observed movement to infer animal swimming direction. This gave rise to the observed paths, thus determining movement effort to further refine latent state inferences. In combination with environmental covariates, the models provide state-dependent habitat use maps enhancing understanding of applied and pure ecological inferences.

4. **Spatially explicit expertise.** Predictive habitat modelling (Generalised Additive Models, boosted regression trees, MaxEnt); Point pattern analysis, kernel density estimation, utilization distributions; Spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I), variogram modelling; Raster-based analysis (for example, bathymetry, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll); Integration of ARGOS, GPS, AIS, and environmental data; Spatial interpolation (for example, kriging); Spatial visualization (ggplot2, leaflet, QGIS, ArcGIS). Application of habitat mapping and risk assessments to support nature-inclusive design and adaptive management frameworks for offshore renewable energy projects.
